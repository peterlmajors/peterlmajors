Hello, my name is Peter Majors, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Fordham University in New York City. 

I am studying Accounting, Information Systems, and Computer Science and will be graduating in Spring 2023! 

I am an aspiring Data Scientist / ML Engineer proficient in Python, R and SQL, while continuing to learn C++, HTML, and CSS. My academic interests involve supervised learning, feature engineering, and Bayesian methods. I have a deep appreciation and understanding of sports analytics and statistics. Looking to translate this skillset in the business or professional sports world.

Relevant Work:

Summer 2022 Finance Innovation and Technology Intern @ Marsh McLennan

  - 3rd Place (of over 20) Teams
  - Utilized XGBoost with advanced college basketball statistics scraped from kenpom.com

Spring 2022 Syracuse Football Analytics Blitz 
  - Top 4 (of 17) Teams
  - Utilized Logistic Regression to predict type of plays run by Kansas City Chiefs offense and develop a defensive playbook.

For now, this account will store personal projects related to sports analytics research, case competitions, and academic assignements.
