Hello, my name is Peter Majors, and I'm currently an Systems Engineer @ Marsh McLennan. 

I am a recent graduate of Fordham University in New York City, where I was the founder and president of the Fordham Sports Anaytics Society. I work with Python, R, SQL, and Javascript - and my techincal areas of interest include statistics, machine learning, SQL databases, and API development. Within machine learning & statistics, my interests include supervised learning, feature engineering, and bayesian methods. I have a broad understanding of sports analytics and statistics, and am looking to translate this skillset into a career. For now, this account will store personal projects related to sports analytics research, case competitions, and academic assignements.

Case Competitions:

1. 2023 NFL Big Data Bowl [Kaggle Submission](https://www.kaggle.com/code/petermajors/evaluating-offensive-linemen-using-oliz)
  - Developed OLIZ, an orientation-responsive zone for pass blockers used to detect the presence of an oncoming pass rusher, to develop measurements related to the performance of pass blockers
  - Leveraged Python, R, and data visualization tools to develop an XGBoost model to analyze the effect of movements in and around the OLIZ and predict player performance
