Hello, my name is Peter Majors, and I'm currently an Systems Engineer @ Marsh McLennan. 

I am a recent grsduate of Fordham University in New York City, where I was the founder and president of the Fordham Sports Anaytics Society. My areas of interests involve supervised learning, feature engineering, and bayesian methods. I have a broad understanding of sports analytics and statistics, and am looking to translate this skillset into a career. For now, this account will store personal projects related to sports analytics research, case competitions, and academic assignements.

  - Leveraged Python, R, and data visualization tools to develop an XGBoost model to analyze the effect of movements in and around the OLIZ and predict player performance
